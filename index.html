    <h1 style=text-align:justify>Dear CÃºn</h1>
        <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;font-size: large;">
        We have been together for 114 days and those have been the most wonderful 114 days of my life. I know that I am not the perfect boyfriend you wished.
            <br><li> I ask too many weird questions </li> 
            <br><li>I overthink everything</li> 
            <br><li> I constantly need reassurance</li>
            <br>Every single day, I am wholeheartedly committed to bettering myself, all for the sake of being an even more loving and devoted partner to you.
            <br>Next month, you will venture into a completely unfamiliar place, unlike any you have experienced before, and unforeseen challenges may lie ahead
            <br> <li>If you are alone, I will be your shadow</li>
            <br> <li>If you want to cry, I will be your shoulder</li>
            <br><li> If you are not happy, I will be your smile</li>
            <br> <li>If you want to talk, just call me, I do not care if I am sleeping or having my own problems. If you want, I always ready</li>
            <br><li> And if you need me, I will be right here waiting</li>
        </p>
